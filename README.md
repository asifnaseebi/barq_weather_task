#### Task 2

- Read the file `f1.csv` in `files` directory
- Find the average of the `Max TemperatureC` and `Min TemperatureC` columns
- e.g. for first row: (27 - 15)/2 = 6.0. for second row: (26 - 16)/2 = 10
- Your answer should
  be: `[6.0, 5.0, 3.5, 2.0, 4.5, 4.5, 5.0, 5.0, 5.0, 4.0, 3.5, 5.5, 5.5, 4.5, 5.0, 6.0, 6.5, 5.5, 5.5, 5.0, 5.5, 5.5, 7.0, 5.0, 6.0, 6.0, 5.5, 5.0, 4.5, 4.0, 5.0]`
