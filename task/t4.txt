Sir I have searched nano its very good even better than vim
And I learned various commands from him, the best thing was that there is no need to remember his commands, everything is shown in front.
Switching from one file to another is easy€î
for cut txt = ctrl + k
for undo  = alt + u
save the file = ctrl + x
There is much more to it than that.
